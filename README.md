## Overview: What the Budget App Does

This budgeting app is designed to help users organize their finances through a cohesive experience focused on **budgeting**, **saving**, and **tracking expenses**. Built with a human-centered approach, the app supports manual data entry and encourages users to actively engage with their financial habits, without relying on AI or backend services.

### Key Features

- **Set personalized budget goals** on daily, weekly, monthly, or quarterly cycles.
- **Track expenses** across a wide variety of categories (e.g., groceries, entertainment, housing, hobbies).
- **Define savings goals**, whether for specific items or general financial security.
- **Manually log expenses and income**, including paychecks, gifts, and other sources.
- **Review trends and reports** to reflect on spending habits and progress toward goals.
- **Track upcoming bills** and recurring payments.
- **Simulate real-world use** with pre-populated example data such as recent transactions and due dates.

### Target Audience

This app is intended to serve a broad range of users, including:
- College students (both enrolled and non-enrolled)
- Parents managing household budgets
- Early-career individuals

It is designed to support users across diverse **socioeconomic backgrounds** and encourage flexible usage patternsâ€”whether logging expenses in real-time at a store or doing a weekly review at home.

### Design Philosophy

Rather than presenting a set of disjointed features, the app offers a **holistic and user-friendly experience** that blends budgeting, savings, and financial tracking into a smooth, unified flow. 

While this is a prototype, it is thoughtfully designed to look and behave realistically, prioritizing:
- **Manual data entry** with intuitive form design
- **Clear financial categorization**
- **User customization and preferences**
